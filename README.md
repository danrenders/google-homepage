What I've learned:

1. Doing step-by-step tutorials online is all fun and dandy. Then I actually had to build a page from scratch, and realized I didn't know nearly as much as I thought I did. 

2. For me, once I began to understand flexbox, my header, body and footer began to look much more clean than just using inline styles and playing with padding. Float styles work, but they're not favorable (in my opinion) due to layout issues when re-sizing the browser. 

3. I'm still having difficulty evenly spacing and centering Icons, but I'm glad i'm becoming more familiar with placing them on my webpage. 

4. If it takes a while to figure something out, give it some time. After spending about 4 hours on 2 different problems I was having, a good night's sleep did wonders. I woke up wanting to get back to work, and I was able to think more clearly. 

5. I learned alot from simply playing around with CSS styles once I became more familiar with them. Once connected to the live server, you can see all updated in real time. This way you can determine your favorite method on how to create and style your webpage. 

6. The most important thing I've learned: It's okay to feel lost sometimes. Use Google to help guide you. It also helps to use your dev tools to help get a better understanding on how pages are put together. I feel like I've memorized very little when it comes to CSS styles/methods. The only way I became familiar with the styles I used was to plug and play. Only then did I actually begin to understand which each style did for my page. 

7. I have a LONG way to go.
